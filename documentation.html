<h1>The server</h1>

<h2>Concept</h2>
Torncraft is an all-inclusive, friendly community-based Minecraft server with multiple gamemodes, all centered on the feats a community can achieve.

<h2>Supporting the server</h2>

<h3>Donations</h3>
Torncraft runs entirely off of and is dependent on donations. As we have no stable source of money, we need the players to help us with paying for the server. If the monthly needs of the server are not met, Torncraft goes down, either shortly or forever. This has been the case for as long as Torncraft has been public.

<h3>Attracting new people</h3>
In order to function as a server, we must keep a constant flow of new people coming in, preferably ones that will stay and be nice.
Unfortunately, as past experiences tell, this has been incredibly difficult to manage. Want to help? Here's what you can do:
<br><br>
<b>Vote</b>: Every now and then, in Torncraft, links will come up that ask you to vote. This increases our server's score and possibly brings in new players. As a return gift, we give you $25 in-game money for voting.
<br>
<b>Tell your friends</b>: From experience, word of mouth has proven to be the most powerful force in attracting people to Torncraft. Most people here are linked together in some way. Everyone brings their friends and plays together.
<br>
<b>Tell people on MCF or other servers</b>: Be careful on this one. Make sure you follow the rules of wherever you are posting. We are not responsible for any problems you get from this.
<h1>The plugins</h1>
This section is for plugins used in Torncraft. They are divided into two sections: gameplay-altering and technical, and affect certain worlds as indicated. Gameplay-altering plugins alter gameplay in some way easily noticeable by the player, while technical plugins serve as a base for the server to run on, although players may have <i>some</i> gameplay-altering effects.
