<h1>The server</h1>

<h2>Concept</h2>
Torncraft is an all-inclusive, friendly community-based Minecraft server with multiple gamemodes, all centered on the feats a community can achieve.

<h2>Rank System</h2>
There are seven ranks, ordered in importance and influence in the server:<br><br>

<b>[<font color="D9A334">O</font>] : Owner</b><br>
Owns the server. There is absolutely no way to get this.<br>
<b>[<font color="be0000">A</font>] : Administrator</b><br>
There is virtually no way to get this. Prerequisite: Moderator.<br>
<b>[<font color="be00be">M</font>] : Moderator</b><br>
Get <i>selected by the staff</i> and choose to do this job. If you ask for it, you won't get it. Prerequisite: Trusted<br>
<b>[<font color="3ffe3f">T</font>] : Trusted</b><br>
Play everyday and cause no problems in the server. No donation required. However, it can be combined with donator to get all donator perks plus access to extra worlds.<br>
<b>[<font color="3ffe3f">$$$</font>] : Contributor</b><br>
Donate $20 or more. Lasts for a month.<br>
<b>[<font color="00bebe">$</font>] : Donator</b><br>
Donate $5 or more. Lasts for a month.<br>
<b>... : User (no prefix)</b><br>
Log in once to the server.<br>

<h2>Supporting the server</h2>

<h3>Donations</h3>
Torncraft runs entirely off of and is dependent on donations. As we have no stable source of money, we need the players to help us with paying for the server. If the monthly needs of the server are not met, Torncraft goes down, either shortly or forever. This has been the case for as long as Torncraft has been public.

<h3>Attracting new people</h3>
In order to function as a server, we must keep a constant flow of new people coming in, preferably ones that will stay and be nice.
Unfortunately, as past experiences tell, this has been incredibly difficult to manage. Want to help? Here's what you can do:
<br><br>
<b>Vote</b>: Every now and then, in Torncraft, links will come up that ask you to vote. This increases our server's score and possibly brings in new players. As a return gift, we give you $25 in-game money for voting.
<br>
<b>Tell your friends</b>: From experience, word of mouth has proven to be the most powerful force in attracting people to Torncraft. Most people here are linked together in some way. Everyone brings their friends and plays together.
<br>
<b>Tell people on MCF or other servers</b>: Be careful on this one. Make sure you follow the rules of wherever you are posting. We are not responsible for any problems you get from this.
<h1>The plugins</h1>
This section is for plugins used in Torncraft. They are divided into two sections: gameplay-altering and technical, and affect certain worlds as indicated. Gameplay-altering plugins alter gameplay in some way easily noticeable by the player, while technical plugins serve as a base for the server to run on, although players may have <i>some</i> gameplay-altering effects.
<h2>Gameplay-altering</h2>
<h3>Lockette</h3>
<h3>Factions</h3>
<h3>Craftconomy</h3>
<h2>Technical</h2>
<h3>Multiverse</h3>
<h1>The worlds</h1>
<h2>Main Survival (Factions)</h2>
<h2>Economy-based Survival (Old Torn)</h2>
<h2>Vanilla Survival (Trusted)</h2>
<h2>Plots Creative</h2>
<h2>Freebuild Creative (Trusted)</h2>
<h1>Technicalities in the rules</h1>
This section outlines exceptions to the rules, random scenarios that may or may not occur again, and rules for admins that don't apply to players.
<h2>1. Separation of Staff and Player</h2>
Staff must be faction- and group- neutral and keep his/her survival mode game out of mind when doing anything staff-related or in the mindset of a staff member. To illustrate this, let's take a real world example. (names replaced with standardized names)<br><br>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<b>There are four people:</b><br>
Bob, a normal player in Faction X,<br>
Larry, a moderator and the leader of Faction Y,<br>
Moe, a normal player in Faction X,<br>
and Joe, a moderator in Faction Y.<br><br>
<b>The case:</b><br>
Moe, a spy for Faction Y, unclaims all land in Faction X, including Bob's house.<br>
Bob later comes online and is dismayed that his house is claimed by Faction Y. He begs Larry to unclaim his house.<br>
Larry, thinking Joe claimed Bob's house using moderator powers, unclaims it and gives an angry letter to Joe. Note that as the leader of Faction Y, he could have also done this as a player.<br>
Bob thanks Larry and leaves.<br>
Joe comes online and notices that Bob's land is claimed by Faction X. Then he notices the angry letter by Larry and explains that Moe unclaimed all land of Faction X.<br>
Larry realizes this and that his mistake lost his faction the rich loot of Bob's house. However, he has to leave, but tells Joe to reclaim Bob's house using moderator powers.<br>
Joe reclaims Bob's house with moderator powers.<br><br>
<b>The result:</b><br>
Bob complains that Joe did admin abuse and Larry's unclaim was fair because it was his mistake.<br>
Joe tells Bob that his reclaim was fair because Larry made a moderator mistake.<br><br>
Who is correct? Bob or Joe?<br>
